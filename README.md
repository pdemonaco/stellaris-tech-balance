A general attempt at making weapon technology more relevant to gameplay. 
1. Weapons scale in potency as their cost (power & mineral) increases. 
2. Shield attributes have been updated to be proportional to their weapon counterparts.
3. Hull values on ships have been updated to reflect this change as well.
