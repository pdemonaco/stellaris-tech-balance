A general attempt at making weapon technology more relevant to gameplay. 
1. Weapons scale in potency as their cost (power & mineral) increases. 
2. Shield attributes have been updated to scale proportionally to their internal representation.
3. Min distances for military stations have been reduced from 200 to 20. This allows useful construction of stations.
